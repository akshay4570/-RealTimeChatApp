Basically it is a chat application similar to Whatsapp but a beginner level, made use of ReactJS,NodeJS and highlight of the show is use of Socket-IO without which it is 
not possible to have built this, and also used intermediate concepts of React such as hooks,lifecycles etc.

The code is modular and divided into different components for scalability purposes.Deployed on Heroku and Netlify.
